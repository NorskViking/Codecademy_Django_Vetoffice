# CodeCademy: Vetoffice Django Project

## Overview

This is a Django Project, using the Vetoffice Project, from [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-python-web-apps-with-django) as a basis, and building and expanding upon this project.

This project is a personal project, for learning Django and its many functions.

The Vetoffice is a learning project provided in the codecademy skill path, for learning how to build a python web app with Django. I will be using the basics from this project, and expand and build upon it. In this project, I will be using Django, Python, SQLite, HTML, CSS and Git, for development, designing and deploying the project.

Any and all names and other information used for filling the database and other variables, are complete fabrication, and have no relation to any real physical entities.

## Planed Expansion

* SQL Database
	* Expanding the database to include several more animals
	* Adding a description field to the Appointment table, where information of the reason for the appointment can be added(sickness, injury, grooming etc.)
	* Add several 'patients' with 'owners' and different corresponding 'appointments'
* Webpage
	* Expand upon the basic HTML and CSS code provided for the learing project, to create a more pleasing website, with potential for use of login and appointment request.
* Django
	* Create an RESTfull API for the django-project.
