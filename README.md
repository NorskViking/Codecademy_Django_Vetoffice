# CodeCademy: Vetoffice Django Project

## Overview

This is a Django Project, using the Vetoffice Project, from [Codecademy](https://codecademy.com/learn/paths/build-python-web-apps-with-django) as a basis, and building and expanding upon this project.

This project is a personal project, for learning Django and its many functions.

The Vetoffice is a learning project provided in the codecademy skill path, for learning how to build a python web app with Django. I will be using the basics from this project, and expand and build upon it. In this project, I will be using Django, Python, SQLite, HTML, CSS and Git, for development, designing and deploying the project.
